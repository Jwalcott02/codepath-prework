## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

#### Favorite Apps and Features:

1. **Twitter**  
   - Retweeting posts with added comments  
   - Bookmarking tweets for later viewing  

2. **Spotify**  
   - Personalized playlists  
   - Dark/light mode toggle  

3. **Uber**  
   - Live tracking of rides  
   - Estimated fare calculation  

4. **TikTok**  
   - Interactive filters  
   - Personalized video recommendations  

#### App Idea:
"My app would be a **Daily Planner** where users can add tasks for each day, set reminders for important tasks, and track their daily progress. I would implement a simple, intuitive UI with color-coded tasks for easy tracking. One feature would be a notification system to remind users of overdue tasks."

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. 

- Encountered issues with setting random colors on the screen but solved it by implementing a random color generator function.
- Figuring out how to change the background color dynamically was a bit tricky at first, but after reviewing documentation, I was able to set the background color using a UIButton action.
- **Challenge**: Understanding Swift syntax and concepts, especially how to connect UI elements to code and handle button actions.
